# Next Gen Test Gen
Software that generates an online timed quiz. Time is deducted for incorrect answers. These modifications to this assignment take into account some of our recent exposure to Node.js. We also feature this app as deployed on heroku. 

## Project Description

This application is pretty-much now a feature on heroku. You can see it working by accessing it here ---> [Heroku deployment of quiz app.](https://online-zen-quiz-app.herokuapp.com/)

The code here can be modified to admit any number of questions and have any length of time or an open ended time limit. 

Time limit penalties are assigned here using the following code: 

***

You can access this portion of the code in "take-quiz.js" and reset the parameters to those of your choosing. 

Have fun!
